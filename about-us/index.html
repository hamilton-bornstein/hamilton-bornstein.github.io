    <h1>Why are we running?</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This is a question that we have been asked a couple of times. Why are we 
        running to become the next Chairman and Lieutenant Chairman of the Cupertino 
        Alliance? The answer is simple. We love the Cupertino Alliance. We have seen 
        this organisation grow into one of the largest of its kind in the micronational 
        community, and we have helped to cultivate this growth over time, authoring 
        legislation, participating in sessions, as well as hosting them. We see it as 
        our duty to the Cupertino Alliance, its member states, and its delegates, to 
        step up and rise to the challenge of running this great organisation for the 
        next six months, to enable the Alliance to continue to grow and prosper.

    <h1>A message from Daniel Hamilton</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Hello! I’m Daniel Hamilton, and I’m running for Chairman of the Cupertino Alliance this 
        August. I’ve been a micronationalist since April 2020, and since then I have served in 
        many positions throughout the micronational community. I have represented the Unified 
        Royal States of Australis in the Cupertino Alliance since we were first admitted as a 
        member state on 15 July 2020, one year ago. I was appointed by then-Chairman Jayden Lycon 
        in September 2020 as the Deputy Minister for Asian and Oceanic Affairs and confirmed as 
        the Minister for Asian and Oceanic Affairs a month later. Since then, I have hosted dozens 
        of successful and productive sessions, some lasting up to four hours, uninterrupted. I have 
        also written and passed several acts for the Cupertino Alliance, some of the most notable of 
        these being the Safeguarding Act, which established the position of Safeguarding Officer, and 
        the Main Region act, which provided an important framework for regional ministries in relation 
        to the Chairman of the Alliance. As many of you know, I ran for Chairman in the last election. 
        As John C. Maxwell put it, <span style="font-style: italic;">“There is no success without failure and losses.”</span> 
        Despite being unsuccessful in my last candidacy for Chairman in January, I 
        have returned and would like to bring my ideas to the Cupertino Alliance.

    <h1>A message from James Bornstein</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Hi, I’m James Bornstein, and I hope to be the next Lieutenant Chair of the Cupertino 
        Alliance. I’ve been a member of this alliance for over 8 months, and have served in 
        numerous positions throughout the micronational community, such as New Virginia, 
        Australis, Ponderosa Hills, and Anthea to name a few. Since Desert District was accepted 
        as a member in October 2020, I can attest that this organization has been crucial in our 
        development. With projects that help assist with MicroWiki pages, projects that help delegates 
        grow plants from seeds, and many more, this Alliance truly caters to the needs of every delegate. 
        Nevertheless, some projects have unfortunately gone inactive, and there are many more that we’re 
        able to create. Though some may say it’s unrealistic to revive inactive projects and even launch 
        new ones, there’s no doubt in my mind whatsoever that if all of us contribute, this Alliance can 
        do nearly anything. I’ve written bills for Cupertino Parliament, have served as the Acting Superior 
        Judge, and have served on several committees. My running mate Daniel Hamilton has served as the 
        Minister for Asian and Oceanic Affairs. If you’re looking for a ticket that has a proven track record 
        of hard work and dedication, vote Hamilton-Bornstein.
