    <h1>For the Alliance.</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Here's a quick rundown of what we will do if we get elected:
      <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Extensive Superior Court reforms for transparency and accessibility</span><br>
            The Superior Court of the Cupertino Alliance has suffered from a severe lack of development 
            and activity since it was created, only being used intermittently for handling complaints and 
            suspending delegates. The Cupertino Alliance Superior Court has not seen a court case in its 
            history. Even if a case were to come up in the Superior Court, there is no place to hold said 
            case. In addition, we have discovered that the methods for filing a case in the Superior Court 
            are far from optimal. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Writing a new Charter to futureproof the Cupertino Alliance, to be completed by December 2021</span><br>
                A work of art when it was first implemented, the 
                Charter of the Cupertino Alliance Act, 2020 has 
                become outdated for the modern day. If elected, a 
                Hamilton-Bornstein administration will continue the            
                work of the Ross-era Charter Committee. We pledge 
                to have written a new Charter for the Cupertino 
                Alliance by the end of December 2021. This new 
                Charter will bring in all of the reforms of our 
                administration into one new document, which will 
                serve as an effective Charter for the Alliance for several 
                terms to come.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Membership reforms including a new application form, better remarks and better utilisation of the CASC</span><br>
            We've spoken to several individuals, many of whom were once potential Cupertino Alliance members, 
            who decided not to apply to join our organisation. Asking them why they decided not to join, it 
            is clear that several issues have arisen in the application process. The only ways to apply to 
            join the Cupertino Alliance is to go onto MicroWiki, onto the Cupertino Alliance page, and click 
            the application form link on the page, or to ask another delegate for the application link. We will 
            make sure that the application is posted prominently on the Cupertino Alliance server. We see 
            membership as an ongoing topic in the Cupertino Alliance, which is why we will shift our priorities 
            for membership to the ongoing development of members as they grow in the Alliance. Due to this change 
            in direction for the organisation, we would like to rename the Ministry of Membership Attainment to 
            the Ministry of Membership and Recruitment, to better reflect the ongoing commitment to this organisation's 
            members. The rest of our concerns for the membership process in this organisation have been answered below 
            with several new solutions, to revitalise the Ministry of Membership Attainment.

            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Mutual cooperation with GUM and regional organisations for events, diplomacy and recruitment</span><br>
            The Hamilton-Bornstein campaign is committed to establishing several outreach programs with other 
            micronational organisations, in order to strengthen diplomatic ties between the Cupertino Alliance 
            and other organisations. We would also look to host joint events with these organisations, such as 
            a virtual summit to raise funds for charity, as mentioned previously in this manifesto. These outreach 
            programs will help recruit members from these organisations into the Cupertino Alliance, and vice versa 
            via recruiting drives. 
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Ministry changes including the renaming of some ministries, and the creation of a Ministry of Statistical Information</span><br>
            One of the major policies of the Hamilton-Bornstein campaign is reforming the cabinet of the 
            Cupertino Alliance for the future. The greatest issue currently facing our cabinet is inactivity. 
            Several ministries have either been made redundant by other ministries or have no work to do. As 
            a result of this, we have decided that, if elected, we will make major changes to the ministries 
            of the Alliance, by merging several ministries together, forming new ones, and also renaming some 
            ministries to better reflect their ongoing purpose. We will also be using a monthly task list 
            system, which is essentially a list of jobs that each ministry must complete each month. We predict 
            that using this system, productivity within the Cupertino Alliance cabinet will exponentially increase. 
            We also plan to make things more democratic within our Alliance. Instead of creating a predetermined 
            list of cabinet picks, we will publicly open nominations for all ministerial positions. This will allow 
            for a more diverse and democratic cabinet, instead of one restricted to a certain group of people.

            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">
                Creation and revival of several projects and events such as a 24-hour session 
                for charity, Cupertino Guides and CAoNI as well as other new projects
            </span><br>
            Projects are an essential part of the Cupertino Alliance. As important as they are, unfortunately 
            many with great potential have been left to gather dust. We are dedicated to bringing these projects 
            back, as well as taking our organisation into the future with brand new ones.

            <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Maintaining our social media presence with a consistently active Twitter and Instagram account, and updating CA MicroWiki pages</span><br>
            In order to continue to grow in size as an organisation, we need to increase our public visibility. The 
            Hamilton-Bornstein campaign has devised a plan to bring different, often forgotten about sectors of the 
            micronational community together by advertising the Cupertino Alliance on places like Twitter and Instagram. 
            A bit closer to home, we would also like to maintain an active presence on MicroWiki, to show to the well-renowned 
            MicroWiki community that we are a high-quality organisation.
